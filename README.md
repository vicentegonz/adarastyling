Office data analisis 
Main Assumptions:
- I did not use the deleted column for the assignment.
- Each question has it's answer file if needed insted of one answer file for everything.
- Some columns that should've been modified (line_text in speaker column) where prosesed as characters, to solve this we could have ignored them when adding to the characters but without modifying the dataframe column.
- Some otliners weren't treated, like (name, nmae).
- Groups of speakers where treated as different speakers (name1, name2) -> as (name1), (name2).  <br>

There are commits in different days and hours of a same day, this is beacouse I worked in intervals due to other University assignments that needed to be done.
In other words I respected the time constraint.
