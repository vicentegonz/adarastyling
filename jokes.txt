Example 1:
jim: wow! that is really hard. you really think you can go all day long? well, you always left me satisfied and smiling, so...
michael: that's what she said!
jan: michael. michael!

Example 2:
kevin: [holds up the piece of tree he just cut off with a paper cutter] well, sort of. why did you get it so big?
michael: a, that's what she said, and b, i wanted it to be impressive. the biggest day of the year deserves the biggest tree of the year.
kevin: but what are we going to do with this hacked off part?

Example 3:
doctor: does the skin look red and swollen?
dwight: that's what she said.
michael: that's my joke, damnit dwight.

Example 4:
oscar: [jim popping michael's bubble wrap cast] you should put butter on it.
michael: uh, that's what she said.  see, haven't lost my sense of humor.  no, no need, it was a non-stick grill.
jim: i've had a foreman grill for about six years, i've done about 85% of my cooking on it, but i've never burnt myself, probably because i don't use it as a pillow.

Example 5:
pam: i have a ton of stuff to do for the wedding. and i have to do it in the office. and that can be kind of awkward. um... just because people can get all weird about wedding stuff. then... i just... i don't want to offend... angela... or someone.
michael: that's what she said!
dwight: ha! i don't get it.

Example 6:
angela: you already did me.
michael: that's what she said. [jim mouths these words along with michael] the thing is, angela... you are in here an awful lot. you have complained about everybody in the office, except dwight, which is odd because everyone else has had run ins with dwight. toby, by the way, what does 'redacted' mean? there is a file full of complaints in here marked 'redacted'... ?
toby: yeah, it just means whoever complained came to me later and withdrew it, so i took their name off.
